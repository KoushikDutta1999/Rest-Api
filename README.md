### CRUD

> In regards to its use in RESTful APIs, CRUD is the standardized use of HTTP Action Verbs.

> This means that if you want to create a new record you should be using “**POST**”. If you want to read a record, you should be using “**GET**”. To update a record use “**PUT**” or “**PATCH**”, And to delete a record, use “**DELETE**”.

## HTTP Verbs 

Below are the various types of HTTP Verbs

- ### POST

> A POST request is utilized to send data to a server to create a resource, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. usually using HTML Forms.

- ### GET

> The GET method is used to retrieve specific resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

- ### PUT

> PUT is similar to POST as it is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. The difference between it replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

- ### PATCH

> The PATCH method is used for making partial changes to an existing resource. The PATCH method provides an entity containing a list of changes to be applied to the resource requested using the URI.

- ### DELETE

> As it sounds, the DELETE request method is used to delete resources indicated by a specific URI. Making a DELETE request will remove the targeted resource.

- ### PUT vs PATCH

> PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
